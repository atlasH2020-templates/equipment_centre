The ATLAS Equipment Centre translates application maps from the standardized ATLAS format into the target format required by the target tractor (Shapefiles, ISOXML, ...). The "as applied" values are collected and transformed into the ATLAS standard format and then recorded on the field data serviceâ€™s applications ledger.
The ATLAS Equipment Centre also provides a user interface to manage the AppEngines a farmer owns or contracts, view their status (online/offline, location, ...), install, update and uninstall apps on AppEngines to enable "smart" on-board functionality for selected tasks.
